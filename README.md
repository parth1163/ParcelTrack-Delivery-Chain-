# ParcelTrack-Delivery-Chain-
This project, named ParcelTrack, is a C program that simulates a simple delivery chain using a linked list. It's designed to track a package's journey through various logistical hubs, providing key information such as total distance traveled and time between stops. The project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.

Features
Dynamic Data Structure: Uses a singly linked list to represent the delivery chain, allowing for flexible additions and removals of hubs.

Hub Management: Includes functions to add hubs to both the head and tail of the list.

Chain Analysis:

Total Distance: Calculates the sum of distances between all hubs.

Bottleneck Detection: Identifies the largest time gap between any two consecutive hubs.

Hub Search: Finds a specific hub by searching for a keyword in its name.

Chain Manipulation: Allows for the removal of the first hub that matches a given search keyword.

Output Control: Provides functions to print the entire delivery chain in both forward and reverse order for detailed tracking.
